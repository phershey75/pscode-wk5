// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
1. Display "Enter the first number:"
2.Input the first number from the user and store it in a variable called num1
3. Display "Enter the second number:"
4. Input the second number from the user and store it in a variable called num2
5. Add num1 and num2 together and store the result in a variable called sum
6. Display "The sum of" + num1 "and" + num2 + " is "  + sum
 

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1. Start
2. Display "Enter the number -"
3. IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
    DISPLAY "Number is Even"
    ELSE
    DISPLAY "Number is Odd"
    END IF
5. STOP

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. input n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
2. avg = (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
3 small = n1
4.large = n1
5. for i = 2 to 5:
6. if n1> ni then:
  small = ni
7.if n1 < ni then:
   large = ni
8. print("Average.", avg)
9. print("Smallest.", small)
10.print("Largest.", large)
